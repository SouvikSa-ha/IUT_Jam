Collect Ingredients and cook to survive from hunger. Vitality drops while moving and recharges upon resting. Health gets damaged by the enemy and regenerates taking food. Any stat dropping to zero results in game over. Enemies have distinct behavior and field of view. 4 different areas have different enemies as well as ingredients to be found. Ingredient A can be found on the northeast, B on the southeast, C on the northwest, and D on the southwest.

Use deadly spells for your advantage with the cost of backfiring on you. Spell ingredients can be collected from enemies' dead bodies as same location as food ingredients.

Controls:
- WASD to move.
- I to open inventory
- C to open cooking menu (required staying on the cooking platform)
- P to pause
